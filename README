Parrot - a fortune picker.

Expects a fortune file in ./fortunes. Saves some indexing data to ./index.dat.

Usage:
	./parrot --rebuild-index = rebuilds the index. This needs to be run before
		drawing any fortunes.
	
	./parrot = just reads the whole input and says something interesting.
	
	./parrot --echo = the same, just echoes the input before appending the fortune.

	./parrot --continuous = reads the whole input and says something interesting.
		Then it says something interesting about that after waiting for 10
		seconds, and repeats.

Usage as a mail signature generator:
	Pipe the mail through "parrot --echo". In a Vim macro:
		:noremap <C-E> :%!parrot --echo

Files:
	common.h
		Contains common type definitions and declarations.

	parrot.c
		Contains most fortune-picking code.

	tokenizer.{c|h}
		Tokenizes input.

	hash.{c|h}
		Calculates a hash of tokens for faster manipulation.

	index.{c|h}
		Implements an index that contains lists of fortunes for every significant token,
		plus a list of all fortunes.

	build-index.{c|h}
		Handles index building.

	fortune-set.{c|h}
		Saves "fortune - score" pairs and allows score-weighted random picking.

	lcs.{c|h}
		Calculates the length of the longest common substring of two hash_t arrays.

	examples/*
		Example inputs.

	fortunes
		Fortune files, concatenated together.
