Parrot - a fortune picker.

Expects a fortune file in ./fortunes. Saves some indexing data to ./index.dat.

Usage:
	./parrot --rebuild-index = rebuilds the index. This needs to be run before
		drawing any fortunes.
	
	./parrot = just reads the whole input and say something interesting.
	
	./parrot --echo = the same, just echo the input before appending the fortune.

	./parrot --continuous = reads the whole input and say something interesting.
		Then say something interesting about that, and so on.

Usage as a mail signature generator:
	Pipe the mail through "parrot --echo". In a Vim macro:
		:noremap <C-E> :%!parrot --echo
